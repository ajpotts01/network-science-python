       "'One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found  himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his  armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his  brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off  any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the  rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.    \"What\\'s happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn\\'t a dream. His room, a  proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between  its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out  on the table Samsa was a travelling salesman and above it there hung a  picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and  housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur  hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered  the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.    Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of  rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.  \"How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this  nonsense\", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do  because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state  couldn\\'t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his  right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a  hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\\'t have to look at the  floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull  pain there that he had never felt before.    \"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career it is that I\\'ve chosen!  Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more  effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there\\'s  the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad  and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that  you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can  all go to Hell!\" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself  slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his  head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with  lots of little white spots which he didn\\'t know what to make of; and  when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly  back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold  shudder.    He slid back into his former position. \"Getting up early all the time\",  he thought, \"it makes you stupid. You\\'ve got to get enough sleep. Other  travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go  back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,  these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my boss; I\\'d get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn\\'t  have my parents to think about I\\'d have given in my notice a long time  ago, I\\'d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell  him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\\'d fall right  off his desk! And it\\'s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there  at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,  especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard  of hearing. Well, there\\'s still some hope; once I\\'ve got the money  together to pay off my parents\\' debt to him another five or six years I  suppose that\\'s definitely what I\\'ll do. That\\'s when I\\'ll make the big  change. First of all though, I\\'ve got to get up, my train leaves at  five.\"    And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.  \"God in Heaven!\" he thought. It was half past six and the hands were  quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like  quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the  bed that it had been set for four o\\'clock as it should have been; it  certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep  through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept  peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What  should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch  that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was  still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and  lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his  boss\\'s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the  five o\\'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor\\'s  not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss\\'s  man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported  sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five  years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would  certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance  company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the  doctor\\'s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed  that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\'s more,  would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,  apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel  completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.    He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to  get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a  cautious knock at the door near his head. \"Gregor\", somebody called it  was his mother \"it\\'s quarter to seven. Didn\\'t you want to go  somewhere?\" That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own  voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had  before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and  uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out  at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,  leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor  had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the  circumstances contented himself with saying: \"Yes, mother, yes,  thank-you, I\\'m getting up now.\" The change in Gregor\\'s voice probably  could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was  satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short  conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,  against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came  knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. \"Gregor,  Gregor\", he called, \"what\\'s wrong?\" And after a short while he called  again with a warning deepness in his voice: \"Gregor! Gregor!\" At the  other side door his sister came plaintively: \"Gregor? Aren\\'t you well?  Do you need anything?\" Gregor answered to both sides: \"I\\'m ready, now\",  making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by  enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,  individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister  whispered: \"Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.\" Gregor, however, had  no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for  his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors  at night even when he was at home.    The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being  disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only  then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he  would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in  bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps  caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure  imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve  themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change  in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,  which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.    It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow  himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became  difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He  would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead  of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in  different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If  he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would  stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with  that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about  painfully. \"This is something that can\\'t be done in bed\", Gregor said  to himself, \"so don\\'t keep trying to do it\".    The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out  of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not  imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it  went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly  shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose  the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned  from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might  well, at present, be the most sensitive.    So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,  carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,  and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually  followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last  got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him  that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not  injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the  same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better  to stay in bed than lose consciousness.    It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,  but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as  they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was  possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this  chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to  stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free  of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,  though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was  much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this  he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he  could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was  enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to  offer him. \"Seven o\\'clock, already\", he said to himself when the clock  struck again, \"seven o\\'clock, and there\\'s still a fog like this.\" And  he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps  expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and  natural state.    But then he said to himself: \"Before it strikes quarter past seven I\\'ll  definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody  will have come round from work to ask what\\'s happened to me as well, as  they open up at work before seven o\\'clock.\" And so he set himself to  the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all  at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and  kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to  it falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he  was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably  raise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.    When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed the new method  was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and  forth it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody  came to help him. Two strong people he had his father and the maid in  mind would have been more than enough; they would only have to push  their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend  down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over  onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that  all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he  could not suppress a smile at this thought.    After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have  been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time  was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very  soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. \"That\\'ll be  someone from work\", he said to himself, and froze very still, although  his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet. \"They\\'re not opening the door\",  Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of  course, the maid\\'s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear the visitor\\'s first words of greeting and he  knew who it was the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the  only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became  highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,  every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful  and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he  couldn\\'t get out of bed if he didn\\'t spend at least a couple of hours  in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one  of the trainees make enquiries assuming enquiries were even  necessary did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have  to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that  only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate  it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any  proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn\\'t really a loud noise. His fall was  softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor\\'s back was also more  elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too  noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit  it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against  the carpet.    \"Something\\'s fallen down in there\", said the chief clerk in the room on  the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that  had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you  had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this  question, the chief clerk\\'s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots  could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,  Gregor\\'s sister whispered to him to let him know: \"Gregor, the chief  clerk is here.\" \"Yes, I know\", said Gregor to himself; but without  daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.    \"Gregor\", said his father now from the room to his left, \"the chief  clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\'t leave on the  early train. We don\\'t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to  speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be  good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\" Then the chief  clerk called \"Good morning, Mr. Samsa\". \"He isn\\'t well\", said his  mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through  the door. \"He isn\\'t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have  missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly  makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he\\'s been in  town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in  the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His  idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He\\'s made a little  frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you\\'ll be  amazed how nice it is; it\\'s hanging up in his room; you\\'ll see it as  soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I\\'m glad you\\'re here; we  wouldn\\'t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;  he\\'s so stubborn; and I\\'m sure he isn\\'t well, he said this morning that  he is, but he isn\\'t.\" \"I\\'ll be there in a moment\", said Gregor slowly  and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word  of the conversation. \"Well I can\\'t think of any other way of explaining  it, Mrs. Samsa\", said the chief clerk, \"I hope it\\'s nothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever  become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,  we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\" \"Can  the chief clerk come in to see you now then?\", asked his father  impatiently, knocking at the door again. \"No\", said Gregor. In the room  on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left  his sister began to cry.    So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only  just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she  crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief  clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that  happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same  demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that  yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of  abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the  carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously  have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor  discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later  on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace  instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the  others didn\\'t know what was happening, they were worried, that would  excuse their behaviour.    The chief clerk now raised his voice, \"Mr. Samsa\", he called to him,  \"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more  than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary  concern to your parents and you fail and I mention this just by the  way you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite  unheard of. I\\'m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your  employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I  am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and  sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with  peculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible  reason for your failure to appear, it\\'s true it had to do with the  money that was recently entrusted to you but I came near to giving him  my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now  that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish  whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all  that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in  private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good  reason I don\\'t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your  turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\\'s  not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;  but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.  Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\"    \"But Sir\", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the  excitement, \"I\\'ll open up immediately, just a moment. I\\'m slightly  unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\\'t been able to get up. I\\'m  still in bed now. I\\'m quite fresh again now, though. I\\'m just getting  out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It\\'s not quite as easy as I\\'d  thought. I\\'m quite alright now, though. It\\'s shocking, what can  suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents  know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last  night already. They must have noticed it. I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t let  you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness  without staying at home. Please, don\\'t make my parents suffer! There\\'s  no basis for any of the accusations you\\'re making; nobody\\'s ever said a  word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven\\'t read the latest  contracts I sent in. I\\'ll set off with the eight o\\'clock train, as  well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don\\'t need to  wait, sir; I\\'ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good  as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!\"    And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was  saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers this was easily  done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed where  he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the  door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief  clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn  what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked  then it would no longer be Gregor\\'s responsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason  to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for  eight o\\'clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth  chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself  one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was  in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let  himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the  edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and  kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.    \"Did you understand a word of all that?\" the chief clerk asked his  parents, \"surely he\\'s not trying to make fools of us\". \"Oh, God!\"  called his mother, who was already in tears, \"he could be seriously ill  and we\\'re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!\" she then cried. \"Mother?\"  his sister called from the other side. They communicated across  Gregor\\'s room. \"You\\'ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor  is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just  now?\" \"That was the voice of an animal\", said the chief clerk, with a  calmness that was in contrast with his mother\\'s screams. \"Anna! Anna!\"  his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping  his hands, \"get a locksmith here, now!\" And the two girls, their skirts  swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the  front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get  dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;  they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something  awful has happened.    Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\\'t  understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to  him, clearer than before perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and  were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been  confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had  been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith  he expected great and surprising achievements although he did not  really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be  crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he  coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even  this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he  was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had  become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the  table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed  against the door and listening.    Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once  there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself  upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He  rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and  then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his  mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth how was he,  then, to grasp the key? but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up  for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start  the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some  kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the  key and dripped onto the floor. \"Listen\", said the chief clerk in the  next room, \"he\\'s turning the key.\" Gregor was greatly encouraged by  this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his  mother too: \"Well done, Gregor\", they should have cried, \"keep at it,  keep hold of the lock!\" And with the idea that they were all excitedly  following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying  no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned  round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright  with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the  whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it  snapped back was Gregor\\'s sign that he could break his concentration,  and as he regained his breath he said to himself: \"So, I didn\\'t need  the locksmith after all\". Then he lay his head on the handle of the  door to open it completely.    Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open  before he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one  of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not  want to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still  occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to  anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \"Oh!\",  which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him he was  the nearest to the door his hand pressed against his open mouth and  slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.  Gregor\\'s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief  clerk\\'s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,  took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into  her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head  disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and  clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with  his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.    So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the  other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half  of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant  over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had  become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the  other side of the street which was a hospital could be seen quite  clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its  faÃ§ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual  droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from  breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for  Gregor\\'s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and  he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of  different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph  of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand  and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his  uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the  front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and  the stairs where they began their way down below.    \"Now, then\", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have  kept calm, \"I\\'ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and  set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see\", he said to  the chief clerk, \"that I\\'m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being  a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn\\'t  earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you  report everything accurately, then? It\\'s quite possible for someone to  be temporarily unable to work, but that\\'s just the right time to  remember what\\'s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,  once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all  the more diligence and concentration. You\\'re well aware that I\\'m  seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my  parents and my sister, so that I\\'m trapped in a difficult situation,  but I will work my way out of it again. Please don\\'t make things any  harder for me than they are already, and don\\'t take sides against me at  the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn  an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That\\'s just  prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But  you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in  fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss  himself it\\'s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes  about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And  you\\'re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year  away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip  and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\'s almost impossible to  defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\'t usually even hear  about them, or if at all it\\'s when we arrive back home exhausted from a  trip, and that\\'s when we feel the harmful effects of what\\'s been going  on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don\\'t go away, at  least first say something to show that you grant that I\\'m at least  partly right!\"    But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to  speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his  trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment  while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without  taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been  some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had  reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot  from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he  stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,  there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.    Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk  go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into  extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very  well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would  provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much  to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for  the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk  had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the  future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were  here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still  lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,  surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the  entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was  not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without  considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move  about in his present state, or that his speech still might not or  probably would not be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself  through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,  ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but  Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought  something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had  that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel  alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;  to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even  making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon  believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held  back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there  on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,  at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up  with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \"Help, for  pity\\'s sake, Help!\" The way she held her head suggested she wanted to  see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards  showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind  her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she  sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even  seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush  of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.    \"Mother, mother\", said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had  completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help  himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of  coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and  into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,  had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already  reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for  the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of  reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt  down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all  around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,  unfortunately, to put Gregor\\'s father into a panic as well. Until then  he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running  after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he  ran after him, Gregor\\'s father seized the chief clerk\\'s stick in his  right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with  his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with  his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping  his foot at him as he went. Gregor\\'s appeals to his father were of no  help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly  turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.  Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\\'s mother had pulled  open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A  strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the  curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of  them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor\\'s father as  he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor  had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go  very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would  have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he  took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there  was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in  his father\\'s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that  he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable  of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as  possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn  himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to  see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now  and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a  distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that  unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had  nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made  a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He  was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but  then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get  through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it  obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double  doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was  merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room  as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time  to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards  all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to  Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not  a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway  without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted  itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the  white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,  soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by  himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while  those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then  his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from  where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into  his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all  was quiet.          II      It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke  from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards  anyway even if he hadn\\'t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and  felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps  and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully  shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone  palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but  down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to  the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae of which he was  now beginning to learn the value in order to see what had been  happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully  stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the  legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning it was nearly  a miracle that only one of them had been and dragged along lifelessly.    It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it  actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of  something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened  milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so  pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been  that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly  covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in  disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it  difficult to eat the food he was only able to eat if his whole body  worked together as a snuffling whole but the milk did not taste at all  nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister  had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,  almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into  the centre of the room.    Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been  lit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat  with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor\\'s  mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to  be heard. Gregor\\'s sister would often write and tell him about this  reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It  was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody  in the flat. \"What a quiet life it is the family lead\", said Gregor to  himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was  able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and  parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should  come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor  did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,  crawling up and down the room.    Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was  opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on  the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the  room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by  the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room  in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened  no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning  while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,  but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had  clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the  keys were in the other sides.    It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was  put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had  stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as  they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come  into Gregor\\'s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time  to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain  made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he  had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing  other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It  pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift  his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only  regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.    He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light  sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his  hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes  which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being  he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest  consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,  in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.    Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,  as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his  sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and  looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she  did notice him under the couch he had to be somewhere, for God\\'s sake,  he couldn\\'t have flown away she was so shocked that she lost control of  herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to  regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and  came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or  even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the  edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left  the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and  bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn\\'t do  it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,  although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the  couch, throw himself at his sister\\'s feet and beg her for something  good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and  looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some  surprise. She immediately picked it up using a rag, not her bare  hands and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she  would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he  never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did  bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of  things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten  vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that  had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had  declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread  with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water  into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for  Gregor\\'s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for  Gregor\\'s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,  she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that  Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he  liked. Gregor\\'s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What\\'s more,  his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no  difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he  had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger  had still hurt the day before yesterday. \"Am I less sensitive than I  used to be, then?\", he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the  cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much  more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,  his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables  and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn\\'t like at  all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away  from them because he couldn\\'t stand the smell. Long after he had  finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly  turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He  was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he  hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay  there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as  eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could  hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with  bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up  the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at  all as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all  into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under  the couch and stretched himself.    This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning  while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time  after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would  sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor\\'s sister would send  the maid away on some errand. Gregor\\'s father and mother certainly did  not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than  they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being  told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what  distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.    It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor  and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As  nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that  he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\'s  sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was  only later, when she had become a little more used to everything there  was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the  situation that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at  least a comment that could be construed as friendly. \"He\\'s enjoyed his  dinner today\", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all  the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became  more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \"now everything\\'s  just been left there again\".    Although Gregor wasn\\'t able to hear any news directly he did listen to  much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone  speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his  whole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at  first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For  two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they  should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject  as there were always at least two members of the family at home nobody  wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to  leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had  fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\'s mother to let her go without  delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but  she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\\'s  mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.  She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what  had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.    Now Gregor\\'s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;  although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor  often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,  and receive no more answer than \"no thanks, I\\'ve had enough\" or  something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would  sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the  chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing  she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send  the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with  a big, loud \"No\", and no more would be said.    Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained  to Gregor\\'s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or  document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when  it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the  complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item  he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news  that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He  had thought that nothing at all remained from his father\\'s business, at  least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never  asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the  family to a state of total despair, and Gregor\\'s only concern at that  time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it  as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,  with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a  travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance  to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at  work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the  benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good  times and they had never come again, at least not with the same  splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a  position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They  had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the  money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was  no longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained  close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a  gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to  the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense  that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor\\'s  short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to  the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that  could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this  innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he  would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on  Christmas day.    That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind  in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,  when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it  up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be  heard next door and they would all go silent. \"What\\'s that he\\'s doing  now\", his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to  the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be  taken up again.    When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,  partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these  matters himself and partly because Gregor\\'s mother did not understand  everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor  learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was  still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it  had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had  been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so  that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded  with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\'s  debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from  that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better  the way his father had done things.    This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to  live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one  or two years, no more. That\\'s to say, it was money that should not  really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had  to be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self  confidence. During the five years that he had not been working the  first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success he  had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would  Gregor\\'s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered  from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,  every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the  open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still  a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,  consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the  business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all  playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn  money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw  himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot  with shame and regret.    He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink  but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all  the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill  and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing  it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as  what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,  even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present  view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at  all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which  was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could  have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where  the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant  sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always  push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied  up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then  on.    If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for  all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to  bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried  as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,  and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,  but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much  better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she  entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly  close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the  view into Gregor\\'s room, then she would go straight to the window and  pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it  was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little  while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and  noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,  knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this  ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him  with the windows closed.    One day, about a month after Gregor\\'s transformation when his sister no  longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she  came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still  staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most  horrible. In itself, his sister\\'s not coming into the room would have  been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to  immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did  she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,  a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite  her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,  but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she  seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still  found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she  probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little  bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to  spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet  over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely  covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent  down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to  do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no  pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the  sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude  one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how  his sister liked the new arrangement.    For the first fourteen days, Gregor\\'s parents could not bring  themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them  say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even  though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless  and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father  and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor\\'s room  while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again  she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor  had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any  slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and  visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first  persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and  approved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which  made her call out: \"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!  Can\\'t you understand I have to see him?\", and Gregor would think to  himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every  day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand  everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was  still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\\'s  appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.    Gregor\\'s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration  for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during  the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room  to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his  food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain  himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and  ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was  quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;  his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost  happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting  go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of  course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even  with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his  sister noticed Gregor\\'s new way of entertaining himself he had, after  all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about and  got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing  the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and  the desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by  herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen  year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she  certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be  allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to  open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no  choice but to choose some time when Gregor\\'s father was not there and  fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could  hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that  everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her  mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the  couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if  it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this  time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to  see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. \"You  can come in, he can\\'t be seen\", said his sister, obviously leading her  in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of  feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it  from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the  work for herself and ignoring her mother\\'s warnings that she would  strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for  fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the  chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the  job finished before Gregor\\'s father got home and leaving it in the  middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another  thing it wasn\\'t even sure that taking the furniture away would really  be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the  bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\\'t Gregor  feel the same way about it, he\\'d been used to this furniture in his  room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an  empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting  Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone  of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her  words, she added \"and by taking the furniture away, won\\'t it seem like  we\\'re showing that we\\'ve given up all hope of improvement and we\\'re  abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\\'d be best to leave the  room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us  again he\\'ll find everything unchanged and he\\'ll be able to forget the  time in between all the easier\".    Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack  of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led  by the family during these two months, must have made him confused he  could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had  seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to  transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice  furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around  unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly  forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to  forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for  so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;  everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the  furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult  for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great  advantage.    His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the  idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\'s spokesman to his  parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his  mother\\'s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing  not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at  first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was  more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence  she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed  that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the  furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel  they must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what  tempted Grete to make Gregor\\'s situation seem even more shocking than  it was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be  the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling  about the bare walls by himself.    So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor\\'s mother already  looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped  Gregor\\'s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she  had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if  he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women  pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor  poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about  it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,  unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the  next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from  side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His  mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,  so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his  startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front  from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother\\'s attention.  She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out  to Grete.    Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was  happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,  but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little  calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all  these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to  the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand  all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away  everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest  containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove  the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk  where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,  even while he had been at infant school he really could not wait any  longer to see whether the two women\\'s intentions were good. He had  nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to  say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as  they stepped heavily on the floor.    So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room  catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not  knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly  caught by the picture on the wall which was already denuded of  everything else that had been on it of the lady dressed in copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,  it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at  least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by  no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so  that he could watch the women when they came back.    They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;  Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.  \"What shall we take now, then?\", said Grete and looked around. Her eyes  met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was  there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not  look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:  \"Come on, let\\'s go back in the living room for a while?\" Gregor could  see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere  safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly  try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at  Grete\\'s face.    But Grete\\'s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one  side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the  wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw  screamed: \"Oh God, oh God!\" Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch  as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. \"Gregor!\"  shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the  first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She  ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring  her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too he could save  his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull  himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he  could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand  behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he  startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and  broke; a splinter cut Gregor\\'s face, some kind of caustic medicine  splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took  hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;  she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out  from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could  not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she  had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;  and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,  he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in  his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down  into the middle of the dinner table.    He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was  quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete  would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. \"What\\'s  happened?\" were his first words; Grete\\'s appearance must have made  everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and  openly pressed her face into his chest: \"Mother\\'s fainted, but she\\'s  better now. Gregor got out.\" \"Just as I expected\", said his father,  \"just as I always said, but you women wouldn\\'t listen, would you.\" It  was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father  took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was  responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have  to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain  things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of  his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he  came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best  intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would  not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the  door and he would disappear.    His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;  \"Ah!\", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and  glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and  lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the  way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,  he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the  flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected  things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?  The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when  Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting  in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who  was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would  just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they  went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up  tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always  labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already  walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully  and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his  companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed  in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the  employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the  coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his  piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt  white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his  cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in  an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his  trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,  with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not  even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet  unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of  his boots, but wasted no time with that he knew full well, right from  the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to  always be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,  stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,  even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times  without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression  of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time  on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as  especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he  did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up  this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to  carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,  even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as  he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for  running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too  slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;  he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,  here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of  notches and protrusions then, right beside him, lightly tossed,  something flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then  another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was  no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard  him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the  sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw  one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the  floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An  apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\\'s back and slid  off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following  it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself  away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by  changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread  himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the  door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his  mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken  off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her  to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding  one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed  herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him  totally now Gregor lost his ability to see anything her hands behind  his father\\'s head begging him to spare Gregor\\'s life.          III      No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\'s flesh, so it  remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it  there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to  remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and  revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an  enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any  revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.    Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility probably  permanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid  and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room crawling  over the ceiling was out of the question but this deterioration in his  condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the  living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of  closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,  lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the  living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table  and listen to their conversation with everyone\\'s permission, in a way,  and thus quite differently from before.    They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of  course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he  was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All  of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father  would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each  other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew  fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales  job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be  able to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake  up and say to Gregor\\'s mother \"you\\'re doing so much sewing again  today!\", as if he did not know that he had been dozing and then he  would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a  tired grin.    With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\\'s father refused to take his  uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg  Gregor\\'s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always  ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even  here. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of  this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor\\'s  mother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole  evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons  always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,  highly uncomfortable but peaceful.    As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\'s mother would speak gently to his  father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\'t  sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he  was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he  had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at  the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder  than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,  however much mother and sister would importune him with little  reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a  quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.  Gregor\\'s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his  ear, Gregor\\'s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but  nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into  his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would  abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: \"What  a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!\" And supported by the  two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the  greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them  off and carry on by himself while Gregor\\'s mother would throw down her  needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father  and continue being of help to him.    Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give  more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household  budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,  thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came  every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was  looked after by Gregor\\'s mother on top of the large amount of sewing  work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening  conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of  jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both  mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and  celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was  much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out  of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new  address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons  than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it  would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with  a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from  their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,  and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike  anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They  carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor  people, Gregor\\'s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his  mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister  ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but  they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in  Gregor\\'s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had  come back from taking his father to bed Gregor\\'s mother and sister  would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek  to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor\\'s room and say \"Close that  door, Grete\", and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit  in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit  there staring dry-eyed at the table.    Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would  think of taking over the family\\'s affairs, just like before, the next  time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the  chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen  and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from  other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a  tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat  shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, all of them  appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had  forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of  them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times  he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled  with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although  he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he  could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was  entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\\'s sister no longer  thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some  food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work  in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it  away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten  or more often than not had been left totally untouched. She still  cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any  quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there  were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of  the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,  but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing  anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she  had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became  touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the  family understood cleaning up Gregor\\'s room was for her and her alone.  Gregor\\'s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use  several bucketfuls of water to do it although that much dampness also  made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But  his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as  hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the  change in Gregor\\'s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living  room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke  into convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his  chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,  too, became agitated; Gregor\\'s father, standing to the right of his  mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor\\'s room to his  sister; from her left, Gregor\\'s sister screamed at her that she was  never to clean Gregor\\'s room again; while his mother tried to draw his  father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his  sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;  and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the  door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.    Gregor\\'s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after  Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so  his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the  other hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was  here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her  able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\\'t really  repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real  curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor\\'s room and found herself face  to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing  him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in  amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she  never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and  look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so  with words that she probably considered friendly, such as \"come on  then, you old dung-beetle!\", or \"look at the old dung-beetle there!\"  Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just  remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been  opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every  day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt  like it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the  windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to  speak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that  he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like  a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up  one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth  open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her  hand had been slammed down into Gregor\\'s back. \"Aren\\'t you coming any  closer, then?\", she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she  calmly put the chair back in the corner.    Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find  himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take  some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours  and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought  it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but  he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the  habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for  anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms  in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest  gentlemen all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering  through the crack in the door one day were painfully insistent on  things\\' being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since  they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and  especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could  not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought  most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,  many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be  sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their  way into Gregor\\'s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way  in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she  couldn\\'t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,  fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand  that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out  again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out  in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where  they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way  through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it  because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was  forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in  that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile  for hours afterwards.    The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening  meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the  door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor  found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often  failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family  having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,  though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,  and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in  the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,  formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they  unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor\\'s  mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon  behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The  food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen  bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the  food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to  count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of  meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish  whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to  the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\'s mother and  sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and  smiled.    The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor\\'s father  came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once  with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen  stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they  were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to  Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth  could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you  need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything  with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \"I\\'d like to  eat something\", said Gregor anxiously, \"but not anything like they\\'re  eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\"    Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the  violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the  kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one  in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the  others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and  smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up  and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood  pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the  kitchen, as Gregor\\'s father called out: \"Is the playing perhaps  unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.\" \"On the  contrary\", said the middle gentleman, \"would the young lady not like to  come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much  more cosy and comfortable?\" \"Oh yes, we\\'d love to\", called back  Gregor\\'s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The  gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor\\'s father soon  appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister  with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin  playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and  therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,  did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against  the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his  uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the  gentlemen and sat leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to  have placed it out of the way in a corner.    His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one  on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,  Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in  the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he  was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless  about the others. What\\'s more, there was now all the more reason to  keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere  in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,  hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too  indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on  the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this  condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the  immaculate floor of the living room.    No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the  violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in  their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look  at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor\\'s  sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to  the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half  volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor\\'s father observed  them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had  expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had  been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance  and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to  be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the  smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet  Gregor\\'s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one  side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy  expression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head  close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that  he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been  yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister  and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her  violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He  never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;  his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he  wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the  attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,  but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch  with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always  intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told  everyone about it last Christmas had Christmas really come and gone  already? if this misfortune hadn\\'t got in the way, and refuse to let  anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would  break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her  shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to  work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.    \"Mr. Samsa!\", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor\\'s father,  pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor  as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the  three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and  then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more  important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even  though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more  entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them  with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their  room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his  body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear  whether it was his father\\'s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning  realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room  without knowing it. They asked Gregor\\'s father for explanations, raised  their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back  towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\\'s sister had  overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly  interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang  limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still  playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the  instrument on her mother\\'s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for  breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure  from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.  Under his sister\\'s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds  flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the  beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the  room. Gregor\\'s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he  forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and  pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the  middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot  and thereby brought Gregor\\'s father to a halt. \"I declare here and  now\", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor\\'s mother and  sister to gain their attention too, \"that with regard to the repugnant  conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\" here he  looked briefly but decisively at the floor \"I give immediate notice on  my room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,  pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed  with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would  be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\" He was silent  and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his  two friends joined in with the words: \"And we also give immediate  notice.\" With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the  door.    Gregor\\'s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his  hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out  for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept  nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout  all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first  seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps  also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to  move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he  waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on  his mother\\'s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on  the floor.    \"Father, Mother\", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as  introduction, \"we can\\'t carry on like this. Maybe you can\\'t see it, but  I can. I don\\'t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:  we have to try and get rid of it. We\\'ve done all that\\'s humanly  possible to look after it and be patient, I don\\'t think anyone could  accuse us of doing anything wrong.\"    \"She\\'s absolutely right\", said Gregor\\'s father to himself. His mother,  who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,  her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her  eyes.    Gregor\\'s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor\\'s father some more definite ideas. He  sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the  three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at  Gregor as he lay there immobile.    \"We have to try and get rid of it\", said Gregor\\'s sister, now speaking  only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to  listen, \"it\\'ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We  can\\'t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured  like this, we can\\'t endure it. I can\\'t endure it any more.\" And she  broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her  mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.    \"My child\", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,  \"what are we to do?\"    His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness  and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.    \"If he could just understand us\", said his father almost as a question;  his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that  of that there was no question.    \"If he could just understand us\", repeated Gregor\\'s father, closing his  eyes in acceptance of his sister\\'s certainty that that was quite  impossible, \"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement  with him. But as it is ...\"    \"It\\'s got to go\", shouted his sister, \"that\\'s the only way, Father.  You\\'ve got to get rid of the idea that that\\'s Gregor. We\\'ve only harmed  ourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it  were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it\\'s not possible for  human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of  his own free will. We wouldn\\'t have a brother any more, then, but we  could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is  this animal is persecuting us, it\\'s driven out our tenants, it  obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on  the streets. Father, look, just look\", she suddenly screamed, \"he\\'s  starting again!\" In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor\\'s  comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed  herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her  own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind  her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up  half raising his hands in front of Gregor\\'s sister as if to protect  her.    But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his  sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go  back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his  pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal  of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly  raising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked  round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only  been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed  against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister  sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.    \"Maybe now they\\'ll let me turn round\", thought Gregor and went back to  work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had  sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,  everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished  turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the  great distance that separated him from his room, and could not  understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little  while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on  crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a  word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his  head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way  round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough  to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood  up. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen  completely asleep.    He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,  bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that  his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in  so much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung  forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she  turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents \"At last!\".    \"What now, then?\", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the  darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at  all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to  actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was  unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his  entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker  and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already  hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around  it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his  family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must  go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state  of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike  three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light  everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his  head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his  nostrils.    When the cleaner came in early in the morning they\\'d often asked her  not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry  she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she\\'d arrived and  from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace she made her usual  brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought  he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she  attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be  holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with  it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to  make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she  found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all  did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really  happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste  time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness  of the bedrooms: \"Come and \\'ave a look at this, it\\'s dead, just lying  there, stone dead!\"    Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to  make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they  could grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they  hurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went  into Gregor\\'s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room  where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;  she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness  of her face seemed to confirm this. \"Dead?\", asked Mrs. Samsa, looking  at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for  herself and could have known it even without checking. \"That\\'s what I  said\", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\'s body  another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but  did not complete it. \"Now then\", said Mr. Samsa, \"let\\'s give thanks to  God for that\". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his  example. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: \"Just  look how thin he was. He didn\\'t eat anything for so long. The food came  out again just the same as when it went in\". Gregor\\'s body was indeed  completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now  he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make  them look away.    \"Grete, come with us in here for a little while\", said Mrs. Samsa with  a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not  without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened  the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh  air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of  March, after all.    The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in  amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. \"Where  is our breakfast?\", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to  the men that they might like to come into Gregor\\'s room. They did so,  and stood around Gregor\\'s corpse with their hands in the pockets of  their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.    Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his  uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of  them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face  against her father\\'s arm.    \"Leave my home. Now!\", said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without  letting the women from him. \"What do you mean?\", asked the middle of  the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The  other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed  them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could  only end in their favour. \"I mean just what I said\", answered Mr.  Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards  the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if  the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new  positions. \"Alright, we\\'ll go then\", he said, and looked up at Mr.  Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted  permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely  opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,  and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the  front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some  time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they  jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.  Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the  connection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats  from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word  and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out  onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men\\'s  intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three  gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they  turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a  few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa  family lost interest in them; when a butcher\\'s boy, proud of posture  with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer  than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and  went, as if relieved, back into the flat.    They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation  and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but  they were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote  three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her  contractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they  were writing to tell them she was going, she\\'d finished her work for  that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up  from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did  not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \"Well?\",  asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her  face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only  do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich  feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa  all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all  directions. \"What is it you want then?\", asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the  cleaner had the most respect for. \"Yes\", she answered, and broke into a  friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \"well then,  that thing in there, you needn\\'t worry about how you\\'re going to get  rid of it. That\\'s all been sorted out.\" Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down  over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were  writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing  everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite  clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them  all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,  clearly peeved, called out \"Cheerio then, everyone\", turned round  sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.    \"Tonight she gets sacked\", said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply  from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have  destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went  over to the window where they remained with their arms around each  other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat  there watching for a while. Then he called out: \"Come here, then. Let\\'s  forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of  attention\". The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to  him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished  their letters.    After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was  something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the  open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm  sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,  they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination  they were not at all bad until then they had never asked each other  about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held  particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for  the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving  house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper  than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a  better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete  was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late  her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.  Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their  daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became quieter. Just from each other\\'s glance and almost without  knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man  for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good  intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the  first to get up and stretch out her young body.          '"
